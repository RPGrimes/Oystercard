# Oystercard Challenge 

Task from Week 2 on the Makers bootcamp. This task was completed daily during pair-programming sessions with a new partner daily.

Day 1 partner --> [Ginny Thomas](https://github.com/ginnyamazed) - Challenges 1 to 7 completed. We paired using the driver-navigator technique to push-pull commits to our own machines as we took turns. I also felt that we took our time to carefully read, digest and discuss the requirements of each challenge extensively which made writing the tests and the code go smoothly.

## About the task

This week's challenge went back over the basics we covered last week in [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/RPGrimes/Boris_Bikes), giving us the chance to reinforce what we learned last week. We were then challenged to build a more complex system which should really stretch your skills in Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design.

## Challenges
#### Challenge 1 - Create Gemfile
**Learning Objectives covered**
- Construct a valid Gemfile  :white_check_mark:
- Specify a correct source for gems :white_check_mark:
- Specify the latest Ruby version :white_check_mark:
- Add the `rspec` gem to 'test' and 'development' groups :white_check_mark:
- Commit only this Gemfile :white_check_mark:

#### Challenge 2 - Create RSpec Conventional Files
**Learning Objectives covered**
- Generate conventional files (helper and config) for an RSpec project using a command-line option of the rspec executable file :white_check_mark:
- Follow RSpec naming convention for files and folders :white_check_mark:
- Create a test file for the Oystercard class without any tests but with a `describe` block (doesn't exist yet) :white_check_mark:

#### Challenge 3 - Learn Debugging Basics
**Learning Objectives covered**
- Write down the tyoe of error in the issue comments :white_check_mark:
- Write down the file path where the error happened :white_check_mark:
- Write down the line number of the error :white_check_mark:
- Use the Ruby Documentation to find out what the error means :white_check_mark:
- Suggest one way of solving the error :white_check_mark:

#### Challenge 4 - Add the Balance
**Learning Objectives covered**
- Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB :white_check_mark:
- Create a unit test for the `Oystercard` class :white_check_mark:
- Write a failing test that checks that a new card has a `balance` :white_check_mark:
- Write code that will make this test pass :white_check_mark:
- Now refactor by setting the balance in `initialize` using an instance variable :white_check_mark:
- Remove the balance method entirely and replace with an `attr_reader` :white_check_mark:

#### Challenge 5 - Enable 'top up' Functionality
**Learning Objectives covered**
- Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB :white_check_mark:
- Write a test for the `.top_up` method :white_check_mark:
- Make sure the test fails before implementing the method :white_check_mark:
- Implement the method to make the test pass :white_check_mark:

#### Challenge 6 - Enforce Maximum Balance
**Learning Objectives covered**
- Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB :white_check_mark:
- Write a test that checks the `.top_up` method throws an exception if the new balance would exceed the limit :white_check_mark:
- Use a constant to store the limit :white_check_mark:
- Implement the limit in the `.top_up` method. Use an inline `if` statement to check if the limit would be exceeded :white_check_mark:
- Make the error message include the limit value :white_check_mark:
- Use interpolation to keep your code DRY :white_check_mark:

#### Challenge 7 - Deduct the Money
**Learning Objectives covered**
- Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB :white_check_mark:
- Write a test for the `deduct method, see it fail :white_check_mark:
- Implement the method, see the test pass :white_check_mark:

**Self-imposed stretch tasks**
- Enforce minimum balance. We wrote a test that checks the `.deduct` method throws an exception if the new balance would fall below a set minimum value. We set a `MIN_BALANCE` default value of `0` to prevent the `Oystercard` from going into a negative balance. Upon initializing `@min_balance` was created with a user input value to potentially allow an overdraft feature to be added in the future. If no value for `@min_balance` was stated, it defaulted to a value of `0` :sunglasses:




## Reminder of this week's goals from the [Week Outlines](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/week_outlines.md)

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

Start attending [process workshops](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/process_review) to focus on your developer process. Anyone from any cohort ever can attend.

Attending process workshop will help you improve your processes, which in turn makes you a better developer and more prepared for reviews and interviews.

### Wider course goals this week should help with (see all [course goals here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/goals/course_goals.md)):

<dl>
  <dt>I write code that is easy to change</dt>
  <dd>Writing easy to change software is highly prized amongst developers and employers. By developers because most of a developer's time is spent changing software. By employers because their teams can deliver value to customers faster.</dd>
  <dt>I can test-drive my code</dt>
  <dd>Tested software is easier to change because you can tell when it's broken just by running a command, even the tricky edge cases.</dd>
  <dt>I can build with objects</dt>
  <dd>Most code in the world is structured in small pieces called objects. This is done because it is easier to change than having everything in one place.</dd>
